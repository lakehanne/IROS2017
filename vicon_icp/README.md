### Introduction

This code : src/vicon_icp computes the rotation of a point set with respect to a given model point set.

The algorithm is phased from the optimal rotation quaternion computation from the iterative closest point paper detailed in 

```bash
		A Model for Registration of 3D shapes, 
		 Paul Besl and Neil D. McKay
		             Eqs 23 - 27
```
